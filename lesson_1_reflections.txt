Question 4: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When we want to make changes/test to our code, and fear not to break the main code. Make a copy of the code, make the changes and test the changes.
It help us ensure that, changes are tried, tested and working before they are added to the main code. It also helps us, not interupt deployed project or code, while we are making changes.
